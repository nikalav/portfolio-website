            <h1> Theme 01: Basic Web</h1>
            <h2>Responsive website</h2>
            <p>During this theme we've learned to create simple websites and webpages using Basic HTML5 and CSS3. As well as part of UI design, such as: colour theory, thypography, design principles and layouts for web. And finally, we were introduced and teached to make our own web design resposive, using resposive design patterns, grids, images and media queries.

            <h2>XD Prototype, Story without words, Microsite</h2>
            <p>During this theme I've learned how important it is to define certain focus points for different team members, how to compromise and sometimes 'kill my darlings'. During the project of microsite and video, my task was to create the design and improve storyboard for the video. This was my first crucial task and I was very delighted when I met the expectations.

            <p>During this theme we had a short exercise with a diferent team. Our task was to create a short video: "story without words". The idea of the plot was mine, I was happy my groupmates liked the idea and we rushed to sketch our storyboard and film it. During presentation of our videos I heard the teacher and few students say exactly the words I wanted to say with this story, so I felt that I achieved my goal. My groupmates were a big help.

                Can you guess the meaning behind it? </p>

            <h1> Theme 03: Basic Animation</h1>
            <p> This theme contained both individual and group projects. It consisted with a small set of interactive animations, an interactive story with focus on the story, a style and character design.
                During this theme I learned to draw graphics with a consistent visual expression and set on a path to find my own, specific style. I've learned basic animation using CSS and JavaScript, also how to control and use various types of videos, images and sounds.

            <h2> Interactive animation</h2>
            <p>One of the most interesting projects so far. During this project my main field was plot, design and character creation. During it I learned that exhadaration is good, that it's very important to know well your target group and their possible interests. Also this project helped me realise how much I enjoy creating overall design,character and see them come to life.</p>

            <h2>Design Sprint</h2>
            <p>Experience during this theme, gave me a conclusion for the future : arrange the time, make one step at a time, and firstly achieve realistic goals after which some dream parts can be added.</p>
            <figure><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/841e15d2-7792-4222-4948-9e9ebbe1166b-f22f/" target="_blank"><img src="images/sprint.png" alt="xd_prototype"></a>

            </figure>
            <p>Overall, this app prototype has potential. While creating prototype we should not forget adding real content, it is little things but they matter when presenting it to the client. Long term goal: for as many schools institutions and students as possible to use our app. It is a big goal, so as of now we had a sub goal for this app to be used by KEA.</p>
